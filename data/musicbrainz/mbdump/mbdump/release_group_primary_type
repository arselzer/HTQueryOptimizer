1	Album	\N	1	An album, perhaps better defined as a "Long Play" (LP) release, generally consists of previously unreleased material (unless this type is combined with secondary types which change that, such as "Compilation").	f529b476-6e62-324f-b0aa-1f3e33d313fc
12	Broadcast	\N	4	An episodic release that was originally broadcast via radio, television, or the Internet, including podcasts.	3b2e49e1-2875-37b8-9fa9-1f7cf3f49900
3	EP	\N	3	An EP is a so-called "Extended Play" release and often contains the letters EP in the title. Generally an EP will be shorter than a full length release (an LP or "Long Play") and the tracks are usually exclusive to the EP, in other words the tracks don't come from a previously issued release. EP is fairly difficult to define; usually it should only be assumed that a release is an EP if the artist defines it as such.	6d0c5bf6-7a33-3420-a519-44fc63eedebf
11	Other	\N	99	Any release that does not fit or can't decisively be placed in any of the other categories.	4fc3be2b-de1e-396b-a933-beb8f1607a22
2	Single	\N	2	<p>A single has different definitions depending on the market it is released for.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the US market, a single typically has one main song and possibly a handful of additional tracks or remixes of the main track; the single is usually named after its main song; the single is primarily released to get radio play and to promote release sales.</li>\r\n<li>The U.K. market (also Australia and Europe) is similar to the US market, however singles are often released as a two disc set, with each disc sold separately. They also sometimes have a longer version of the single (often combining the tracks from the two disc version) which is very similar to the US style single, and this is referred to as a "maxi-single". (In some cases the maxi-single is longer than the release the single comes from!)</li>\r\n<li>The Japanese market is much more single driven. The defining factor is typically the length of the single and the price it is sold at. Up until 1995 it was common that these singles would be released using a mini-cd format, which is basically a much smaller CD typically 8 cm in diameter. Around 1995 the 8cm single was phased out, and the standard 12cm CD single is more common now; generally re-releases of singles from pre-1995 will be released on the 12cm format, even if they were originally released on the 8cm format. Japanese singles often come with instrumental versions of the songs and also have maxi-singles like the UK with remixed versions of the songs. Sometimes a maxi-single will have more tracks than an EP but as it's all alternate versions of the same 2-3 songs it is still classified as a single.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other variations of the single called a "split single" where songs by two different artists are released on the one disc, typically vinyl.</p>	d6038452-8ee0-3f68-affc-2de9a1ede0b9
