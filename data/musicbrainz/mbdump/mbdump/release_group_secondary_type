11	Audio drama	\N	0	An audio drama is an audio-only performance of a play (often, but not always, meant for radio). Unlike audiobooks, it usually has multiple performers rather than a main narrator.	0eb547c2-8783-43e4-8f81-751c680e7b04

1	Compilation	\N	0	<p>A compilation, for the purposes of the MusicBrainz database, covers the following types of releases:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a collection of recordings from various old sources (not necessarily released) combined together. For example a "best of", retrospective or rarities type release.</li>\r\n<li>a various artists song collection, usually based on a general theme ("Songs for Lovers"), a particular time period ("Hits of 1998"), or some other kind of grouping ("Songs From the Movies", the "Caf√© del Mar" series, etc).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The MusicBrainz project does not generally consider the following to be compilations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a reissue of an album, even if it includes bonus tracks.</li>\r\n<li>a tribute release containing covers of music by another artist.</li>\r\n<li>a classical release containing new recordings of works by a classical artist.</li>\r\n<li>a split release containing new music by several artists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Compilation should be used in addition to, not instead of, other types: for example, a various artists soundtrack using pre-released music should be marked as both a soundtrack and a compilation.</p>	dd2a21e1-0c00-3729-a7a0-de60b84eb5d1
10	Demo	\N	0	A promotional release mostly meant to have limited circulation and demonstrate the sound of an artist to record labels, publishers and other artists.	81598169-0d6c-3bce-b4be-866fa658eda3
8	DJ-mix	\N	0	A DJ-mix is a sequence of several recordings played one after the other, each one modified so that they blend together into a continuous flow of music. A DJ-mix release requires that the recordings be modified in some manner, and the DJ who does this modification is usually (although not always) credited in a fairly prominent way.	0d47f47a-3fe5-3d69-ac9d-d566c23968bf
4	Interview	\N	0	An interview release contains an interview, generally with an artist.	12af3f5e-ce2a-3941-8b93-d482884031e5
6	Live	\N	0	A release that was recorded live. Generally this means "with an audience", be it in person, through the radio or in another similar way.	6fd474e2-6b58-3102-9d17-d6f7eb7da0a0
9	Mixtape/Street	\N	0	Promotional in nature (but not necessarily free), mixtapes and street albums are often released by artists to promote new artists, or upcoming studio albums by prominent artists. They are also sometimes used to keep fans' attention between studio releases and are most common in rap & hip hop genres. They are often not sanctioned by the artist's label, may lack proper sample or song clearances and vary widely in production and recording quality. While mixtapes are generally DJ-mixed, they are distinct from commercial DJ-mixes (which are usually deemed compilations) and are defined by having a significant proportion of new material, including original production or original vocals over top of other artists' instrumentals. They are distinct from demos in that they are designed for release directly to the public and fans; not to labels.	15c1b1f5-d893-3375-a1db-e180c5ae15ed
7	Remix	\N	0	A release that primarily contains remixed material.	0c60f497-ff81-3818-befd-abfc84a4858b
2	Soundtrack	\N	0	A soundtrack is the musical score to a movie, TV series, stage show, video game, or other medium. Video game CDs with audio tracks should be classified as soundtracks because the musical properties of the CDs are more interesting to MusicBrainz than their data properties.	22a628ad-c082-3c4f-b1b6-d41665107b88
3	Spokenword	\N	0	Non-music spoken word releases.	66b8a13e-43ff-3ac0-ac6c-73659d3817c6
